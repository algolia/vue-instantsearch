Vue InstantSearch is available through npm or as a standalone file to
be used in a `<script>` tag.

## Via `npm`

```shell
$ npm install vue-instantsearch --save
# yarn add vue-instantsearch
```

## Using a `<script>` tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue-instantsearch@{{ pkg.version }}/dist/vue-instantsearch.js"></script>
```

Have a look at how to use the standalone UMD build in our codepen example: [codepen.io/rayrutjes/pen/BRgyGV](https://codepen.io/rayrutjes/pen/BRgyGV).

The standalone Vue InstantSearch file is a UMD build, which means it should work in any browser and website combination.
