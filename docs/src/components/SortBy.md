A component that lets the user change the sorting by changing the index the search is operated on.

To be able to sort results with the Algolia engine, you need to have different indices. To read more about sorting with Algolia, please checkout the [official documentation about sorting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/relevance/sorting/#guides).
