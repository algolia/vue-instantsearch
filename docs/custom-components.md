Custom Components
---------

You can build your own components when the provided ones are not sufficient. Since we try
hard as much as possible to provide an out-of-the-box experience, we would love to hear
about your custom component use case before you try to build it.

Let us know about your use case for a custom component via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/algolia/vue-instantsearch/issues).

## What is a custom component

A custom component is a Vue.js component that has access to the [search store](search-store.md).

It can:

- mutate the state of the search store
- get the state from the search store

## How to create a custom component

We have a `Component` [mixin](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html) for you to use:

```html
<!-- CurrentQuery.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    {{ query }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { Component } from 'vue-instantsearch';

export default {
  mixins: [Component],
  computed: {
    query() {
      return this.searchStore.query;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

This component will display the current search query.

## How it works

By using the `Component` mixin, the custom component will automatically be able to access `this.searchStore`.

This is made possible because the `Component` mixin `injects` the searchStore.
You can read more about the inject/provide feature on the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#provide-inject).

The search store will be automatically fetched from a parent [Index component](/components/index.md) higher in the DOM tree.

As a reminder, you can also [provide your custom searchStore to any custom component](components.md#manually-inject-the-search-store-into-components) as a property.

## Best practices

To ensure consistency and re-usability for custom components, we recommend reviewing the following guidelines.

### Styles and CSS classes

* Vue InstantSearch uses `ais` as a prefix for CSS classes, we recommend choosing a different prefix to avoid conflicts
* We do not recommend the use of [`scoped`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/scoped-css.html) styles, it makes it very hard to override them.
* Use the [BEM notation](http://getbem.com/introduction/) with only one depth level.
* Think about reusability: ship the bare minimum style for your component to be displayed well, while allowing for easy customization.

### Vue component

* Use the `Component` mixin that we provide. This will make sure your component can resolve the `searchStore` if not provided. It ensures the `searchStore` prop is available in your component at any time.
* If you need to mutate the `searchStore` multiple times, please use `searchStore.stop()` and `searchStore.start()`, so that other components don't update their rendering on every intermediary state mutation.
* Make sure that when the component is mounted, you catch up with the `searchStore`. You can optionally mutate the state of the `searchStore` at this stage.
* When a component is `unmounted` or `destroyed`, make sure that you leave the `searchStore` in a state that does not include things you might have added (facets / filters / etc.).
* Make sure your component gracefully handles any state of the `searchStore`.
